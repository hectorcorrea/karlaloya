# About me

I am an assistant professor of Educational Leadership at the University of Hartford,
in West Hartford, CT. For two decades I have breathed, learned about, and worked in
higher education. Prior professional experience include a postdoctoral year as an
internal evaluator for an NSF ADVANCE grant at the University of Virginia. The project,
called UVA CHARGE, aimed to increase the recruitment, retention, and success of female
and URM faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and social,
behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences. Before that, I worked for ten years as an
academic administrator at Saint Paul School of Theology, a graduate-level school in
Kansas City, MO.

I completed my Ph.D. in higher education at Pennsylvania State University, my master’s
in higher education at the University of Kansas, and my bachelor’s degree, also in
higher education, at the University of Colima, México.

My academic training in higher education has prepared me to teach an array of higher
education topics. At the University of Hartford, I have taught courses that fall
within three main areas of competence: college teaching and learning, faculty and
students’ experiences in colleges and universities, and educational research methods.
I also guide and supervise doctoral dissertations.

My research comprises three interwoven areas that investigate how the social
identities of students and faculty shape and are shaped by their experiences
in higher education environments to then inform decision making that leads to
more inclusive colleges and universities. The first area is located in the
classroom, and seeks to contribute to making teaching and learning more inclusive
for all learners. The second area examines the experiences of underrepresented
students and faculty members in academic settings. The third area questions how
assessment and research approaches can contribute to supportive environments
and decisions.
